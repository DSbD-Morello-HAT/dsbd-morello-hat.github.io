      <h2>What is Morello-HAT?</h2>

<p> The Morello-HAT project intends to create and evaluate a common API that can be used by 
compiler developers as well as programmers of higher-level languages, 
to allow them to leverage Morelloâ€™s hardware capabilities to improve memory 
security and type safety, spatial as well as temporal, of their language and programs. 
</p>


<h2> Motivation </h2>

<p>
    Currently, the Morello stack supports C and C++ and the capability API is 
    very low-level and pointer-oriented. There are many promising modern 
    languages with fast-growing popularity (e.g. Go, Rust, Dart,) that are 
    not pointer-based and have different type systems and memory management 
    strategies. It is important for the success of the platform that it 
    supports such languages. There is a wide gap between the current low-level, 
    C-focused capability API and the needs of higher-level languages, and that 
    is the gap which this project aims to fill.
</p>
 
<p>
    The libraries and tools we will develop as the key deliverables of this 
    project will make it much easier for programming language developers, 
    compiler writers and programmers to incorporate support for Morello's 
    hardware capabilities into their language ecosystems. As a result, 
    applications developed in those modern, fast-growing languages such as 
    Rust, Go and Dart, as well as future languages, can be ported quickly 
    to Morello. 
</p>

<p>
    The vulnerability detection and mitigation part of the project will 
    demonstrate the effectiveness of our libraries and tools in mitigating 
    exploits through the use of hardware capabilities. In addition, current 
    debug tools heavily rely on high levels of privilege to operate, 
    and with the debug host and debug target located on the same chip, 
    sharing the same memory and registers and reusing the same debug 
    authentication mechanisms leads to the privilege escalation, we 
    therefore will provide a comprehensive defence mechanism across different 
    roles in the ecosystem by introducing an additional security restriction 
    in the Morello stack.
